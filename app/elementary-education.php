                             <p>The Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education with ESOL and Reading Endorsement is designed to furnish students a proficient set of learning skills, as well as provide the ESOL and Reading Endorsement. The program is designed to provide students with general knowledge of teaching and pedagogical practices, as well as specific knowledge relevant to working in the general education field. Both of these aims are necessary for success in future education endeavors, professional careers, and lifelong learning.</p>
                            <p>Doral College students are expected to demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively, to think critically, and to access and use information from multiple sources. The Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education with ESOL and Reading Endorsement program requires students to increase and widen their base of knowledge and understanding by taking courses including Content and Methods in Mathematics, Science, Reading, Art, Music, Health, and Social Sciences. The program also focuses on the incorporation of character education and practical experience, with the theoretical component taught online. In addition, students must be committed to a significant amount of field experience for each theoretical course, averaging at least 15 hours per course.</p>
                                The Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education with ESOL and Reading Endorsement program at Doral College provides the professional preparation necessary to teach grades K through 6, as well as the coursework necessary to earn the ESOL and Reading Endorsement. State of Florida certification requirements are met through coursework, field experiences, and student teaching. The program is designed to bridge the theory to practice gap by engaging in field experiences and one semester of internship experience.</p>
                            <p>State of Florida certification requirements will be met for the Elementary Education Professional certificate with ESOL and Reading endorsement. For this reason students are required to take and pass the Professional Education Exam and the Subject Area Exam before beginning their student teaching placement. Students must provide evidence of a passing score to their Internship placement Instructor.</p>
                            <p>The Department is strongly committed to field experience completed concurrently with courses throughout the program and through student teaching. Therefore all Content and Method courses will require students to complete a 15 hour clock hours of field experience outside the classroom. Students must successfully complete the 15 hours of field experience for each course.</p>
